In my software engineering course, we started to learn about the meteor development system and it apparently is a little slower on Windows devices, like the computer I use. My professor told the Windows users in the class to disable their Windows Defender firewall, as it interferes with meteor and makes run time much longer than it should be. As a person who is impatient I went ahead and disabled it, but I was hesitant at first, for I don't have any other anti-virus installed on my machine. I don't go to any suspicious websites, however my classes require me to scour the internet for information resources and sites that may seem friendly may contain hidden malware. I thought to myself, "It's okay. What are the odds me getting a virus?" and kept on with my studies. Around this time the Wuhan coronavirus had been spreading from China to parts of Europe, making it widespread enough to be dubbed the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. Seeing increasingly more countries become infected had me concerned about contracting it and I thought the same thing to myself, until it was in my own backyard.

The first confirmed case in Hawaii appeared a week prior to UH Manoa's Spring break, and with my flight booked to return home to Maui, I was a little weary of what I may have been exposed to and potentially exposing my family to. The first thing to greet me when I arrived home was congestion, a runny nose, and some coughing. Needless to say, my family and I were concerned, leading me to self quarantine and contact medical professionals until I was in the clear. By some stroke of luck, my symptoms subsided quickly and my family and I are all healthy. The virus had lead to people becoming more distant from eachother in order to protect themselves. Ironically, the threat of me having the virus actually brought me and my family closer together, and once I had recovered we had all become more vigilant for eachother, which is something I can take solace in during these times.  

Along with familial bonding, my time at home was spent doing homework and attempting to teach myself material that would otherwise be taught in-class. Despite having copious ammounts of time on my hands, I was unable to do understand some topics and needed a little more explanation. Normally, I would see my professor and discuss my problem with them, however due to situation worsening in the country, this would become impossible unless done electronically. I tend to understand more when concepts are explained to me in person, however in these trying, I am having to adapt to strictly using online resources for my understanding of new concepts, which is proving to be difficult. For example, in my coding classes I am able to find a myriad of resources online relating to the topic I am learning, but often times what I find online is not ideal or my professors disagree with, which makes.
