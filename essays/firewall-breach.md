In my software engineering course, we started to learn about the meteor development system and it apparently is a little slower on Windows
devices, like the computer I use. My professor told the Windows users in the class to disable their Windows Defender firewall, as it 
interferes with meteor and makes run time much longer than it should be. As a person who is impatient I went ahead and disabled it, but I
was hesitant at first, for I don't have any other anti-virus installed on my machine. I don't go to any suspicious websites, however my
classes require me to scour the internet for information resources and sites that may seem friendly may contain hidden malware. I thought 
to myself, "It's okay. What are the odds me getting a virus?" and kept on with my studies. Around this time the Wuhan coronavirus had been
spreading from China to parts of Europe, making it widespread enough to be dubbed the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. Seeing increasingly more
countries become infected had me concerned about contracting it and I thought the same thing to myself, until it was in my own backyard.
