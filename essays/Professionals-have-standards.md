When writing your traditional essay there are some stric rules you need to abide by in order to even make sense to the reader. These set of rules is called grammar and without proper use, what you want to say won't be understood. This is similar with coding and proper syntax usage, but the person that needs to the syntax to be correct to understand it is the computer. Having this enables the programmer to have a little leg room when coding. As long as the syntax is fine, your code can be formatted in a number of ways and the computer won't complain. But another human reading it might, and they often do. To circumvent this, there are some coding standards that have been made.

The coding standard that I am currently using when typing Javascript is implemented with ESLint, and in order to show my professor my code  I first have to satisfy ESLint. This can be a very trivial task. While trying to make the CPU happy by making my program run correctly and not forgetting semi-colons, I also need to make ESLint happy by making the code look pretty.
