When deciding what I wanted to take up in college I already had an interest in learning programming, but wasn't too sure about career outlook and possible jobs. After taking a few computer science classes and a bit of research, I learned that a couple career paths avaialabe to computer scientists are cyber-security and software engineering. One of the main reasons for me deciding on studying computer science is to one day design video games and have a creative impact in the design process. This made me interested in software engineering, since game design is very intertiwined with software engineering and also seems to give me the creative freedom I wish for. Lucky for me, UH Manoa offers a class for software engineering, so I'm hoping to learn a thing or two from it.

In previous classes, I've learned about Java and some simple applications of it. I've seen how it can be used to make very simple games, but Java isn't the language most games are made in, so I'd like to see what languages would be best for game development and why they are. Another difference I'd like to see is what makes these languages more suited for the idea of software engineering as opposed to Java, since Java seemed very basic, but also able to tackle more tedious tasks like sorting and other algorithms. As I am still new to the world of programming, I am eager to learn about the potential of each language and how to apply them creatively. 

From an outside viewpoint, programming looks very dull and mundane. However, seeing as how some of the most amazing worlds have come to life as a product of software engineering and game development, I see the creative potential it has and I want to master it. I'm sure there are many aspects to the process of software engineering and it may be impossible to be a jack of all trades, but I hope to be well versed in a subject in the field and one day be a part of a team making a game that others find as interesting as I do.
