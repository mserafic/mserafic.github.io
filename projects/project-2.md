This a simple Java program I had developed for my intro computer science course to demonstrate some recently learned skills. In the program I had utilized the EZ imaging software that was given to us for the course to display visuals, and I was responsible for making a program that was able to get user input from both the keyboard and mouse and have some sort of output, for this program it was in the form of differing pictures.

Utilizing the EZ software it was easy to display the desired images, but what was challenging was finding the right functions to give me the desired output. For example, it was simple to have a single mouseclick equate to a single image output, but I wanted one click to equate to continuous images until the mouse was released.

In this project I learned not only how to properly gather user input and display output, but gave me a small taste of troubleshooting and finding answers to my coding challenges by searching for information on sites like Stack Overflow.
